# 🛒 Ecommerce Follow Along Project

Welcome to the **Kalvium Follow-Along E-Commerce Project**! This is a mentor-led, full-stack development journey to build a complete e-commerce application using the **MERN Stack** – MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## 🚀 Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 📚 Learning Goals
- Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learn the foundational steps for setting up a full-stack application.
- Understand core e-commerce functionalities and architecture.
- Set up your project repository for future milestones.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Covered
- **MERN Stack Overview**: Unified JavaScript development across frontend and backend.
- **REST APIs & Endpoints**: Create endpoints for user authentication, product management, and orders.
- **Database Schema Design**: Learn to structure your data with MongoDB models.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure login and registration for users.
- **Backend Foundation**: Lay groundwork using Express and Node.js for scalable backend logic.

### 🧩 What’s Next?
- Set up the development environment and install dependencies.
- Create a basic Express server.
- Understand frontend-backend communication using APIs.

Stay tuned for Milestone 2, where we dive into real backend development! 💻✨

## 🧩 Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, we began laying the foundation for the backend of our e-commerce application.

### Key Accomplishments:
- ✅ Organized backend folder structure (`controllers`, `models`, `routes`, etc.)
- ✅ Created a basic Express.js server
- ✅ Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose
- ✅ Implemented initial error-handling middleware
- ✅ Added CORS and JSON middleware for incoming requests

We are now ready to build API endpoints and handle data storage securely!
## 🧑‍💻 Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller

In this milestone, we added user management functionality to the backend.

### ✅ Key Accomplishments:
- Created a **User Model** to define how user data is stored in MongoDB.
- Built a **User Controller** to handle user registration logic.
- Integrated **Multer** to support image file uploads (e.g., user profile pictures).
- Defined **API Routes** to register users via `/api/users/register`.
- Updated the Express server to serve static files (uploaded images).

Now our backend can accept users and store their data and images securely!
## 🔐 Milestone 7: User Login with Password Verification

In this milestone, we added secure user login functionality.

### ✅ Key Accomplishments:
- Created a `/api/users/login` endpoint.
- Fetched users from the database using email.
- Verified encrypted passwords using `bcrypt.compare`.
- Returned appropriate success or error responses.

This ensures only users with valid credentials can access protected resources.
## 🧩 Milestone 8: Product Cards & Homepage

In this milestone, we focused on designing the visual layout for displaying products on the homepage.

### ✅ Key Accomplishments:
- Created a reusable `ProductCard` component using React and Tailwind CSS.
- Displayed a list of products dynamically using the `.map()` method.
- Implemented a responsive grid layout for a clean user interface.

This marks the beginning of a beautiful shopping experience!
